## Introduction

Low precision operations can provide scalability, memory savings, portability,
and energy efficiency. SWALP averages low-precision SGD iterates with a modified
learning rate schedule and can match the performance of *full-precision* SGD
even with all numbers quantized down to 8 bits, including the gradient
accumulators.

This repo implements SWALP in QPyTorch and provides and example on VGG. 
In training a simulated low-precision VGG model, each epoch takes 23.0s in
this implementation whereas the PyTorch implementation takes 36.8s (measured on
a GTX 1080-Ti GPU).
