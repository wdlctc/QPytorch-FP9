# Training and Inference with Integers in Deep Neural Networks

QPyTorch implementation for the ICLR 2018 paper, [WAGE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04680). This is replicate from the Tensorflow [repo](https://github.com/boluoweifenda/WAGE) by the paper's authors.
We modify this implementation based on our previous [pytorch implementation](https://github.com/stevenygd/WAGE.pytorch).

With QPyTorch the simulation overhead is much smaller. Results are obtained on a GTX 1080 Ti

| Seeting         | Training Time per epoch | Simulation Overhead |
| -------------   | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| No Quantization |                   13.60 |                   0 |
| QPyTorch        |                   17.50 |                 3.9 |
| PyTorch         |                   21.16 |          7.56(1.9x) |
